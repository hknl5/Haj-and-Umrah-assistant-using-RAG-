THE DAY OF ARAFAH: A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

THE DAY OF ARAFAH

The Day of Arafah is the greatest pillar of Hajj, as if what preceded it was in preparation for it and what followed is a continuation of it. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Hajj is Arafah."

It is a venerable day, on which all pilgrims of different colours, countries and needs stand in one place, invoking Allah and supplicating to Him for His mercy and forgiveness.

The Day of Arafah is a day on which the honour of time and place come together, in moments of faith where Allah's mercy and kindness prevail. It is on the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah, and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are the greatest days of the year, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "There is no virtue more to the liking of Allah in any day than in these days, that is, the first ten days of Dhu al-Hijjah."

VIRTUES OF THE DAY OF ARAFAH

1. It is a day on which many people will be freed from Hell: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "There is no day when God sets free more servants from hell than the day of Arafah."

2. Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, brags about the people of Arafah to His honorable angels, out of love and contentment with what they do: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "When the day of 'Arafa comes God descends to the lowest heaven and praises them to the angels saying: Look at my servants who have come to me dishevelled, dusty and crying out from every deep valley."

3. Supplication made on this day is the best and greatest supplication: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "The best invocation is that of the Day of Arafat."

4. It is the most severe day for Shaytaan: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Shaytaan is not considered more abased or more cast out or more contemptible or more angry on any day than on the Day of Arafah. That is only because he sees the descent of the Mercy and Allah's disregard for great wrong actions."

SEASON OF MERCY AND GIFTS

Standing at Arafah is a great moment, in which Allah draws close to His servants. Their calls, concerns and needs are not hidden from Him, despite their different languages and requests.

The Companions and pious predecessors were in two states on that day:
- Some were overcome by shyness and fear of the Almighty in those moments
- Some were dominated by hope, thought well of Allah, and were confident that Allah would answer their supplications

Both states are great.

FASTING ON THE DAY OF ARAFAH

The greatness, bounties and blessings of this day reach all Muslims, even those who did not perform Hajj. For this reason, Allah has prescribed for non-pilgrims to fast on the Day of Arafah so that they are also able to receive some of the blessings.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Fast the Day of Arafah, for indeed I anticipate that Allah will forgive (the sins) of the year after it, and the year before it."

As for the pilgrim, he does not fast, following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him). He did not fast on the day of Arafah during the Farewell Pilgrimage to strengthen himself for the different rituals of Hajj.

THE LOCATION OF ARAFAH

Arafah is a flat plain surrounded by an arc of mountains. It is located between Makkah and Taif, east of Makkah, and outside the boundaries of the Haram.

Specifications:
- Total area: 10.4 kmÂ²
- Distance from Muzdalifah: 6 kilometres
- Distance from Mina: 10 kilometres  
- Distance from the Grand Mosque: approximately 20 kilometres

WHEN TO STAND AT ARAFAH

The Prophet (peace be upon him) stood, supplicating at Arafah, from after the sun had passed its zenith, until sunset and the call to prayer for Maghrib.

It is possible to reach Arafah before this time and leave after it, depending on what is easy for the pilgrim, but the time for supplication begins after the sun has passed its zenith.

The pilgrim must stay with his group and stick to the schedule for transportation and movement.

HOW TO SPEND YOUR TIME

While standing in Arafah, one experiences moments of faith which are irreplaceable, so the pilgrim must make the best use of his time by:

1. Combining and shortening Dhuhr and Asr prayers in congregation with the people in his group, immediately after the sun passes its zenith, or after arrival if he arrived after the zenith.

2. The pilgrim should stay in the camp and not go out except when necessary, as the roads of Arafah are very similar and can be difficult to navigate.

3. The pilgrim should make use of his time and diversify his worship to fight fatigue and boredom, and always remember that these are short moments which will soon pass, while the reward will remain.

Activities to engage in:
- Supplication
- Reciting the Qur'an
- Performing Talbiyah
- Remembering Allah, praising Him and testifying His Oneness

SUPPLICATION ON THE DAY OF ARAFAH

The best supplication and the one closest to being answered is the supplication made on the Day of Arafah, so take advantage of these moments with supplication and recourse to Allah.

Guidelines for supplication:

1. Record your worries and the things you want to pray for before the day of Arafah.

2. Supplicate to Allah in your language and dialect and in the way closest to your heart, for Allah knows all secrets and that which is hidden, and the greatest supplication is what the heart and tongue agree on.

3. Pray for your parents, your family, your brothers and your friends, and mention them by their names. "He who supplicates for his brother behind his back (in his absence), the Angel commissioned (for carrying supplication to his Lord) says: Amen, and it is for you also."

4. Pray to Allah for the good of this world and the Hereafter, and do not be ashamed of asking Allah for your worldly needs.

5. Supplicate to Allah by His Beautiful Names that you know, and say: O Most Merciful (Raheem), have mercy on me, O Forgiving (Ghafoor), forgive me, and O Generous (Kareem), be generous to me.

6. Repeat the same supplication many times, for Allah loves insistency in supplication.

7. Supplicate with all your heart and remember that Allah, the Exalted, is approaching His servants at this time to answer their supplication.

8. Pray to Allah with the supplications of the Qur'an and the Prophetic supplications which you know.

THE DAY OF SACRIFICE: A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

THE DAY OF SACRIFICE

The day of Eid al-Adha (the Day of Sacrifice) is the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah. On this day, pilgrims perform most of their Hajj rituals.

Many scholars consider this day to be "the greatest day of Hajj", since standing in Arafah and the translocation from Arafah to Muzdalifah takes place the night before. On this day, the rest of the great pillars of Hajj will be completed.

THE DEEDS PERFORMED DURING THE DAY OF SACRIFICE

Every moment of the Day of Sacrifice is filled with great deeds:
1. Pelting Jamarat Al-Aqaba
2. Slaughtering your sacrificial animal for those who are obliged to do so
3. Shaving or trimming your hair
4. Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah
5. The Sa'i of Hajj

IS IT NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE DEEDS IN THIS ORDER?

Performing the deeds of the Day of Sacrifice in advance or delaying them:
The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) permitted pilgrims to perform the deeds of the Day of Sacrifice in advance or to delay them, and to choose whatever is easiest for them.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) granted permission to whoever came to ask him about performing one deed before the other. In the Hadith: When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due time his reply was, "Do it and there is no harm."

The pilgrim has to follow the programme of his group in arranging these actions and their times, because that makes it easier for him and other pilgrims and we should accept the permission and facilitation which Allah grants us.

PELTING JAMARAT AL-AQABA

Jamarat Al-Aqaba is the third Jamrah for those coming from Mina and Muzdalifah, and it is the closest to Makkah. It is called Jamarat Al-Aqaba and Al-Jamrah al-Kubra (the big Jamrah).

Procedure:
The pilgrim pelts it with seven pebbles which he picks up from Muzdalifah or on his way, performing Takbeer with every pebble thrown.

Timing:
- When to pelt: The pilgrim pelts it after coming from Muzdalifah
- Start time: The time for pelting the Jamarat begins at midnight for those who hurry and leave Muzdalifah at night
- End time: The time for pelting continues throughout the day and evening of Eid
- The pilgrim, who is able to do so, should not postpone stoning until the sun rises on the eleventh day

Important Guidelines:
- The pilgrim must abide by the time specified for pelting by his group, so as not to harm himself and other pilgrims by crowding them at their allotted time
- You may encounter crowds or pushing while on the move, so remain calm and courteous with the other guests of Allah

PERFORMING TAKBEER

When the pilgrim pelts Jamarat Al-Aqaba, the time for Talbiyah ends, and so he should start performing Takbeer all day and after the obligatory prayers, in glorification of Allah, in remembrance of Him, and in praise of Him for facilitating Hajj for him.

Takbeer Recitations:
"Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha il-Allaah, wallaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa lillaahil hamd."
(Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest. There is no deity besides Allah and Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest and all praises are for Allah only).

Or:
"Allaahu akbar kabeeran, wal-hamdu lillaahi katheeran, wa subhaan Allaahi bukratan wa aseelan"
(Allah is the Greatest, Most Great. Praise is to Allah, abundantly. Glory is to Allah, at the break of day and at its end).

SLAUGHTERING THE SACRIFICIAL ANIMAL

It is prescribed for the pilgrim on this great day to sacrifice his sacrificial animal if he is obliged to do so.

Definition:
The sacrifice is the animal which the pilgrim sacrifices in order to draw closer to Allah during his pilgrimage in Mina or Makkah (within the boundaries of the Haram), after which he eats from it or donates to charity.

The wisdom behind the sacrifice:
1. Drawing closer to Allah, and showing love for Him, glory be to Him
2. Granting relief and giving charity to the poor and the needy
3. The veneration of Makkah and the Sacred House of Allah

WHO IS OBLIGED TO SACRIFICE?

The sacrifice is obligatory for two types of pilgrims:

1. The pilgrim performing Tamattu': He is the one who performs Umrah on his journey, then leaves the state of Ihram, and then enters into the state of Ihram again for Hajj.

2. The pilgrim performing Qiraan: He is the one who combines Umrah and Hajj in his rituals.

It is not obligatory for a pilgrim performing Ifraad, who has taken on the state of Ihram for Hajj only.

Animal Requirements:
The sacrifice should be from the cattle of livestock: Camels, cows, sheep, or goats.

APPOINTING SOMEONE ELSE TO SLAUGHTER IN YOUR PLACE

With the large number of pilgrims today from all over the world, pilgrims usually delegate and appoint the competent authorities to slaughter on their behalf.

If the pilgrim had previously assigned someone to sacrifice on his behalf through one of the available methods, then he has performed the sacrifice on the Day of Sacrifice.

Methods:
This can be done by purchasing physical or electronic vouchers from pilgrim stations, through electronic services, or through your own Hajj group.

Benefits:
This is easier for the pilgrim and makes sure the meat is delivered to those who need it.

Warning:
Beware of dealing with unlicensed individuals or entities when appointing someone else to sacrifice on your behalf, so that you do not become a victim of fraud.

SHAVING AND TRIMMING

After pelting Jamarat Al-Aqaba, it is prescribed for the pilgrim to shave or trim his hair.

For Men: Shave or trim hair
For Women: Bundle their hair and cut about 2 cm / 0.8 inch from it

Spiritual Significance:
All of this is done in an attempt to draw nearer to Allah and glorify Him. The pilgrim worships Allah, and submits to His command. It is forbidden in Ihram to cut his hair and he complies, then he is ordered to shave or trim it and he obeys.

DESIGNATED SHAVING AND TRIMMING AREAS

There are places equipped for haircuts with a large number of approved barber stalls. The pilgrim finds these after pelting Jamarat Al-Aqaba.

HEALTH ADVICE SPECIFIC TO SHAVING

Choose a licensed barber in a designated place. Stay away from road and sidewalk barbers, and do not expose yourself to infectious diseases.

When at the barber, make sure:
- He uses razors with plastic handles, which are disposable
- He changed the shaving tools after the previous pilgrim, and brought out new ones
- He washed his hands with soap and water before he started shaving

LEAVING THE STATE OF IHRAM

After shaving or trimming, the pilgrim will have completed the first dissolution (partial dissolution) of his Ihram. By doing this, it becomes permissible for him to do everything which was forbidden to him because of Ihram, except for intercourse.

After pelting and shaving, it is prescribed for him to take a bath, apply perfume, and put on his clothes for the day of Eid.

If after that he performs Tawaf al-Ifaadah, he has completely dissolved his Ihram, and he is permitted to do what remained of the prohibitions of Ihram.

Important Warning:
Beware of forgetting and losing your personal belongings when showering and using toilets on the day of Eid, and be sure to take your belongings or store them in a safe place.

IMPORTANT WARNINGS BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE GRAND MOSQUE

The pilgrim should not perform Tawaf unless he has fully coordinated with his own group about the specified time assigned to the group, and with clear knowledge of the location of his camp in Mina.

Transportation Note:
Almashaer Metro Line does not go to the Grand Mosque, but there are buses provided by some groups to travel to the Grand Mosque. Memorize the bus stops and assembly points after completing your Umrah.

Gate Information:
When you arrive at the squares around the Grand Mosque, you will find panels in front of the gates, that show those coming from afar whether the gate is suitable for entry or exit.

Tawaf Availability:
Not only the ground floor but all floors of the Grand Mosque are prepared for Tawaf during this day, and the following days.

ESCALATORS

You will usually need to use the escalators to go up or down in the Grand Mosque and reach its squares and services. Safety guidelines:

1. Do not sit on the escalator, even if you are tired
2. Stand firmly on the escalator and hold on to the moving belt
3. Women should be careful that their hijabs and jilbabs do not get stuck at the end of the escalator
4. Walk immediately after the escalator reaches the end so that people do not collide into you from behind
5. Do not take wheelchairs onto the escalator, unless you do so with the help of a competent person
6. If you have an elderly person or a person who is not accustomed to taking the escalator, be by his side and hold him to protect him from falling
7. Do not push people or harm pilgrims if there is crowding while going up or down, and give your brothers an opportunity to get on
8. Do not place your foot on the side brush at the bottom of the escalator, as this may injure you and disrupt the cleaning system of the escalator

TAWAF-UL-IFAADAH

This is one of the most important pillars of Hajj and is also called Tawaf Az-Ziyaarah or Tawaf Al-Hajj. One should circumambulate the Ka'ba seven times. Allah almighty said: "Then let them complete The rites prescribed For them, perform their vows, And (again) circumambulate The Ancient House."

Timing:
- Start time: The time for Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah begins at midnight on the day of Eid on the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah, for those who did not remain in Muzdalifah
- End time: The time for Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah ends with the end of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, but the pilgrim should initiate Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah at the time set for his group on the day of Eid or the days following it

Wheelchair Access:
Electric and manual wheelchairs are available in the Grand Mosque and they can be obtained from a number of locations inside the Grand Mosque.

THE SA'I OF HAJJ

The Sa'i of Hajj consists of seven circuits between Safa and Marwa. Starting from Safa and going to Marwa. If he reaches Marwa, he has completed one circuit, and if he returns to Safa, he has completed the second circuit, and so on, until the seventh circuit ends at Marwa.

It is prescribed for the pilgrim to supplicate at the beginning of each circuit, facing the Qiblah in a place that does not obstruct the passage of others.

WHO IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM SA'I AFTER TAWAF-UL-IFAADAH?

The pilgrim must perform one Sa'i during his Hajj, but there are several different situations:

1. The one performing Tamattu', who performed 'Umrah at his arrival, then left the state of Ihram and then re-entered Ihram for Hajj. He is obliged to perform Sa'i after performing Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah, because his first Sa'i was for Umrah.

2. The person performing Qiraan who combines Hajj and Umrah, and the person performing Ifraad who entered the state of Ihram for Hajj only. For these two, there are two possible situations:
   - If they made Tawaf when they first came to Makkah and then made Sa'i, then that is the Sa'i of Hajj, and they do not have to perform another Sa'i
   - If they did not perform Sa'i before, then they must perform Sa'i after Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah

THE GRAND MOSQUE - A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

Makkah is the best of all lands and the dearest of all lands to Allah and to His Messenger, peace be upon him. Allah has chosen it as the place to perform the rituals of Hajj and considers the journey to it for this purpose an act of worship by which degrees are raised and sins are erased.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, addressing Makkah, "I swear by God that you are the best part of God's earth and the part dearest to Him."

It is the first house of worship ever built on earth for people to worship Allah and declare His unity: "The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka full of blessing and of guidance for all kinds of beings": (3:96)

WHAT IS THE HARAM AND WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?

It is the place where it is forbidden to do certain things that are not forbidden elsewhere. Avoiding such things in this place testifies to one's veneration of Allah who has declared such things forbidden in it: "Such (is the Pilgrimage) : Whoever honours the sacred Rites of God, for him It is good in the sight Of his Lord." (22:30)

Allah has chosen and exalted this land and made it a sanctuary, in which He has forbidden what He has made permissible in other places and conferred on it manifold virtues and benefits that are not found elsewhere.

Its sanctity and lofty status are deeply rooted in the history of the entire universe. Indeed, Allah chose this land and made it sacred on the day He created this universe and it will continue to be as such until the end of time.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Allah made this land sacred the day He created the Heavens and the Earth, so it is sacred by the Decree of Allah until the day of Resurrection."

WHAT DOES THE HARAM MEAN TO ME?

You are now in a place on which Allah conferred a lofty status, honour and virtue before He created humans, and commanded Abraham, peace be upon him, to raise the foundations of the Ka'ba and build its walls upon them to be the prayer direction (qiblah) and provide guidance to all mankind: "The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka full of blessing and of guidance for all kinds of beings:" (3:96)

You are in a place where the reward for one good deed is multiplied many times over, and the sin incurred for one bad deed is not like that committed anywhere else.

Allah commanded his noblest servants, Abraham and Ishmael, peace be upon them, and after them His Messenger, Muhammad, peace be upon him, to purify it, maintain it and take good care of it.

THE BOUNDARIES OF HARAM

The Haram has well-known boundaries which Allah taught Abraham, peace be upon him. Knowledge of these boundaries had been passed down from one generation to another and was ultimately clarified by the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. They can be seen today on the roads leading to Makkah.

Their distances from the Ka'ba differ from one place to another:
From Madinah Road (At-Tan'eem): 6.5 km
From Jeddah Expressway: 22 km
From the new Al-Laith Road: 17 km
From Taif (As-Sail) Road: 12.850 km
From Taif (Al Hada) Road: 15.5 km

The Haram area holds a very special position in Islam because there are rulings related to it for those who enter it.

DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HARAM

There are a number of rules and virtues that pertain solely to Makkah and its Haram, to the exclusion of all other places on earth:

1. Any person who enters it is safe with regard to his life and property and thus must not be killed or wronged in any way. The Almighty says, "Whoever enters it is safe." (3:97)

2. The reward for one single prayer in the Haram including all mosques and houses in Makkah that are within it is equivalent to one hundred thousand prayers anywhere else.

3. Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter it.

4. It is forbidden to engage in any form of hunting in it.

5. It is forbidden to cut down its trees or grass.

During the Hajj season, entry to Makkah is efficiently organized and anyone without a Hajj permit is not allowed to enter so that pilgrims may be served in the best possible manner.

THE KA'BA

The Ka'ba is the direction which Muslims face in their prayers (qiblah) and to which their hearts incline. It is only around it that they perform Tawaf as an act of worship to Allah the Almighty.

The Ka'ba has four corners that are named after the directions they face:
- The Yemeni Corner to the south
- The Black Stone to the east
- The Syrian Corner to the west
- The Iraqi Corner to the north

Al-Hateem (Hijr Ismaa'eel): This is a semi-circular open space next to the Ka'ba, part of which used to be of the Ka'ba.

The Door of the Ka'ba:
- It is located on the eastern side of it.
- Its length is 318 cm and its width is 171 cm.
- It is made of pure gold and weighs 280 kilograms.

Al-Multazam: This is the eastern wall or part of it between the Black Stone and the door of the Ka'ba. Iltizaam refers to the act of placing one's chest, face, arms and palms on this wall and supplicating to Allah for whatever one wishes. Doing so may be difficult or impossible during the Hajj season and in overcrowded conditions.

Al-Meezaab (The Roof Drain): This is the part that is attached to the roof of the Ka'ba to channel water from the roof, which then falls onto Hijr Ismaa'eel.

Ash-Shaadharwaan (The Riser): This is a structure that supports the Ka'ba and surrounds it from three sides. It was initially erected to strengthen the Ka'ba and protect it from torrential rain. It has been preserved over the years and is covered today with white marble.

THE BLACK STONE

- The Black Stone is one of the stones of Paradise, as the Prophet, peace be upon him, once mentioned.
- It is the start and finish point of each circuit that pilgrims perform around the Ka'ba.
- The Prophet, peace be upon him, deposited it in its proper place following a dispute that broke out between people as to who should have the honour of raising it to its place after part of the Ka'ba was damaged by heavy rain.

The Location of the Black Stone:
- It is located in the southeastern corner of the Ka'ba.
- It rises 1.5 m from the ground.

The Silver Frame:
- The Black Stone is encased in a silver frame that serves to protect it.
- The first to join the parts of Black Stone with silver was 'Abdullaah ibn Az-Zubayr, may Allah be pleased with him.

Touching and Kissing the Black Stone:
- A pilgrim should touch and kiss the Black Stone after each circuit, as this was the practice of the Prophet, peace be upon him, only if possible during the off-seasons when there is no overcrowding.
- A pilgrim should perform takbeer (say, 'Allaahu akbar') when touching it or waving at it from afar in case of overcrowding.

A Muslim must avoid jostling and crowding to kiss the Black Stone, as this may cause harm to himself and others.

MAQAAM IBRAAHEEM (ABRAHAM'S STATION)

Maqaam Ibraaheem is the stone on which Abraham, peace be upon him, stood when he was building the Ka'ba. It is one of the clear signs in the Haram, as the Almighty says, "In it are signs manifest; (for example) the Station of Abraham; " (3:97).

Its Shape: It is square-shaped with two oval pits in the middle bearing the footprints of Prophet (Ibraaheem), peace be upon him.
Its Colour: The shades of black, yellow and white.
Its Size: Its width, length and height are 50 cm.
Its Location: In front of the door of the Ka'ba, 10-11 m east of the Ka'ba

- The stone is housed today in a glass enclosure.
- It is also silver-coated from all sides.

Anyone who has performed Tawaf around the Ka'ba is recommended, when possible, to perform two-rak'aas between Maqam Ibraaheem and the Ka'ba in a place that is suitable for prayer even if it is far away. As the Almighty says, "And take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer" (2:125)

However, strictly follow the instructions of security officers and try not to harm or harass others when performing this prayer. You can pray anywhere behind Maqaam Ibraaheem, far away from crowds, or anywhere in the Grand Mosque.

SAFA AND MARWA

These are two small mountains which Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, peace be upon him, climbed in her search for food or water.

Safa: A small mountain from which Sa'i begins. The mountain rocks are still visible on the ground floor of the Mas'aa.

Marwa: A small mountain at which Sa'i ends.

Performing Sa'i between Safa and Marwa is one of the rituals of Hajj and Umrah. The Almighty says, " Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of God." (2:158)

THE WELL OF ZAMZAM

- It is located east of the Ka'ba, 21 meters away from it.
- The circumference of the well is 3.60 m.

Other Names of Zamzam:
- Suqyaa Ismaa'eel (Allah's Gift of Water to Ishmael).
- Saafiyah (Pure).
- Mubaarakah (Blessed).
- Saalimah (Flawless).
- Taahirah (Pure).

Caliphs and kings throughout the ages have taken great care of the well of Zamzam. This interest has continued to the Saudi era.

This began with the reign of King Abdulaziz, may Allah have mercy on him:
- In 1345H (1926), he gave orders to install drinking fountains to provide Zamzam water for free (Sabeel).
- In the following year, he ordered the construction of the second Sabeel drinking fountains, as well the restoration of the well and the placement of a cover over it.

And has continued until the reign of King Salman, may Allah protect him:
- In 1439H (2018), he gave orders to complete the Zamzam Well restoration project.
- He also ordered the construction of five-service bridges to Zamzam well from the eastern side.

Zamzam Watering Department: It monitors the operations connected with the Well of Zamzam so that water is offered to pilgrims performing Hajj and Umrah according to the highest quality standards.

Zamzam Laboratory:
- This service supervises the stages of sterilization of Zamzam water.
- It monitors the process of filling water tankers that transport Zamzam water to the Prophet's Mosque.

THE IHRAAM: A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

INTRODUCTION

Ihraam is the first step in your journey of Hajj, and it is an act of the heart with which you enter into a great act of worship. Allah commanded us to form sincere intentions for Hajj and Umrah and to perform them for His sake, Glory be to Him, to the fullest extent. As the Almighty said: "And complete the Hajj or Umrah in the service of God."

WHAT IS IHRAAM?

Ihraam is entering into the act of worship for Hajj or Umrah, which is done by forming the intention to enter into Umrah or Hajj and begins with the Talbiyah.

One has to declare the exact form of worship that he intends at the beginning of his Talbiyah, saying: "Labbayka 'Umratan" or "Labbayka Hajjan". By saying this he enters the state of Ihraam and starts his worship of Hajj or Umrah.

It is Sunnah to perform ghusl (bathe) or wudhu (ablution) and enter into Ihram after an obligatory prayer or after praying two rak'aat.

As soon as he has formed the intention, he will have begun his rituals and must abstain from all the prohibitions of Ihraam.

THE CLOTHES OF IHRAAM

For Men:
The person in Ihraam wears a robe which is wrapped around the lower part of his body, and a robe which covers the top. Its colour should be white. He can use a buckle or belt that wraps around his waist to hold his Izaar (the robe covering the lower part of his body) from falling and to keep his belongings, phone, and money in.

For Women:
Women take on the Ihraam in whatever clothes they want, provided that they are:
1. Loose and wide, covers everything and does not hinder movement.
2. It has no adornments which are attractive to men.

Significance:
All people are equal in their dress and appearance, and are not separated by colour or material things, and they stand on equal footing, supplicating to Allah and imploring Him.

STIPULATION

If the pilgrim performing Hajj or Umrah fears that he will not be able to complete his rituals due to a disease or a legitimate excuse or a reason outside of his control, then it is permissible for him to stipulate the intention. He does so by saying this after declaring his ritual when saying "Labbayka 'Umratan" or "Labbayka Hajjan":

"If anything prevents me, then my place is where You prevented me."

(he can say this in any language he prefers).

If he says this and stipulates a condition, and then something prevents him from completing the ritual, it is permissible for him to leave the state of Ihraam, and there is no atonement required from him.

TALBIYAH

Talbiyah is when you say: "Labbayk-Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk. Innal hamda wan-ni'matah laka wal-mulk, laa shareeka lak"

English Translation: "At Your service, Allah, at Your service. At Your service, You have no partner, at Your service. Truly all praise, favour and sovereignty is Yours. You have no partner."

Meaning: O Allah, we came, answering Your call to perform Hajj or Umrah time after time, acknowledging You in monotheism and worship, acknowledging Your grace and the perfection of Your supreme authority.

It is the majestic motto of the pilgrims, which declares servitude and obedience to the Creator, the Blessed, Glory be to Him.

Men raise their voices and women perform talbiyah silently.

When Talbiyah Starts and Ends:
- Talbiyah starts from the beginning of Ihraam
- For the person performing Umrah: ends when they see the Ka'ba
- For the person performing Hajj: ends when pelting Jamarat Al-Aqaba

THE MIQAT

In veneration of the Sacred House of Allah, the Messenger of Allah specified places before Makkah from which those coming for Hajj and Umrah must enter the state of Ihraam. They begin reciting Talbiyah before they reach the boundaries of the Haram. These locations vary according to the location one is travelling from.

The pilgrim or the visitor who lives far from Makkah is obliged to enter the state of Ihraam from these Miqats or a place that is adjacent and parallel to them on their way, whether traveling by plane or land. One should not go beyond these points without entering Ihraam.

The Five Miqats:

1. Dhul Hulaifa: The miqat for the people of Madinah, which is 420 km (260 miles) from Makkah.

2. Al-Juhfah: The miqat for the people of the Levant and those on their way, and it is 187 km (116 miles) from Makkah. Nowadays people enter the state of Ihraam at 204 km (128 miles) from Rabigh.

3. Qarn Al Manazil: The miqat for the people of Najd and those on their way, which is 94 km (58 miles) from Makkah.

4. Yalamlam: The miqat for the people of Yemen and those on their way, 115 km (71 miles) from Makkah.

5. Dhat Irq: The miqat for the people of Iraq and those on their way, and it is 92 km (57 miles) from Makkah.

Air Travel: Usually, planes coming to Jeddah announce the timing of alignment with the Miqat, so that pilgrims coming for Hajj and Umrah can enter into the state of Ihram.

Three Types of People for Ihraam:

1. Whoever is in Makkah:
- Enters the state of Ihraam to perform Umrah from the nearest place outside the Haram, such as the mosque of the Mother of the Believers 'Aishah in Tan'im.
- One takes on the state of Ihraam for Hajj from his current place.

2. Whoever is located between Makkah and the Miqat:
- Enters into the state of Ihraam for Hajj and Umrah from his current place.

3. Whoever is beyond the Miqat:
- Must enter the state of Ihraam from the Miqat or a location that is adjacent to it for Hajj or Umrah.

PROHIBITIONS WHILE IN THE STATE OF IHRAAM

General Prohibitions (for both men and women):
- Sexual intercourse
- Entering a marriage contract
- Hunting
- Shaving or clipping nails
- Applying perfume

Prohibitions for Men:
- Covering the head
- Wearing clothes that consist of sewn joints

Prohibitions for Women:
- Covering the face

THINGS WHICH ARE NOT FORBIDDEN DURING IHRAAM

- Showering
- Wearing glasses, rings, and watches
- Bandaging wounds
- Wearing a belt and purse around the body
- Wearing shoes
- Carrying a parasol
- Women covering their face when they fear tempting others or when there are men nearby

PREVENTION OF SKIN IRRITATION AND INFLAMMATION OF BODY FOLDS

The problem of skin irritation and inflammation of body folds is common among pilgrims performing Hajj and Umrah, especially among people with obesity or diabetes. The skin becomes infected and redness occurs in the folds of the thighs, and sometimes in the armpits or under the breasts, accompanied by annoying and painful itching.

How to Prevent:
- Good ventilation of body folds such as thighs and armpits
- Pay attention to personal hygiene and use ointments on your body before walking

Treatment:
When infected, use healing ointments and wash the area well before applying the medication.

ETIQUETTE FOR A PERSON IN THE STATE OF IHRAAM

From the moment the pilgrim performing Hajj and Umrah enters into the state of Ihraam, he is involved in a great act of worship and must mind his words, actions and behaviour and try to increase his rewards, as the Almighty said: "For Hajj are the months well known. If anyone undertakes that duty therein let there be no obscenity nor wickedness nor wrangling in the Hajj. And whatever good ye do (be sure) God knoweth it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me o ye that are wise!"

Guidelines:

1. You have to renew your intentions and sincerity to Allah the Exalted. The fact that you came all the way to perform Hajj out of love for Allah and in response to His command, seeking His mercy and reward, and fearing His punishment. You did not come to show off or out of arrogance, nor so that people can say: "So-and-so performed Hajj", nor to be called a pilgrim with the nickname "Haaj".

THE JAMARAT: A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

WHAT IS PELTING THE JAMARAT?

Pelting the Jamarat is one of the great rituals of Hajj that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did and commanded us to do.

This is done by throwing a specific number of small pebbles at the place specified by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in Mina, which is called the Jamarat.

The Jamarat is not a specific wall or the pole towards which pebbles are thrown, rather the name of the area in which pilgrims should aim their throw.

THE THREE JAMARAT

There are three Jamarat which are pelted:

1. The Small Jamrah: This one is also referred to as the first Jamrah. It is the first Jamrah after Al-Khayf mosque in Mina when heading towards Makkah.

2. The Middle Jamrah: This is the second Jamrah, after the small Jamrah and before Jamarat Al-Aqaba.

3. Jamarat Al-Aqaba: Also referred to as the big Jamrah, it is located at the end of Mina when heading towards Makkah.

Order from Al-Khayf mosque towards Makkah:
1. The Small Jamrah
2. The Middle Jamrah  
3. Jamarat Al-Aqaba

THE STORY OF THE JAMARAT

When Allah commanded His Prophet Ibraahim to slaughter his son Ismaa'il, he responded to the command of Allah and went to implement this command, but Shaytaan objected to him at the site of the small Jamrah, and whispered to him not to slaughter his son. Ibraahim threw seven pebbles at him, and he disappeared and vanished. 

Ibraahim went away, only to be intercepted by Shaytaan, at the middle Jamrah, so he threw seven pebbles at him again, and Shaytaan disappeared and vanished. 

Finally, Shaytaan intercepted Ibraahim (peace be upon him) a third time, at Jamarat Al-Aqaba, and once again he pelted him seven times and Shaytaan disappeared.

Ibraahim (peace be upon him) proceeded to carry out the command and so he placed his son on his forehead to slaughter him. It was then that Allah called him saying: "We called out to him, 'O Abraham! Thou hast already fulfilled The vision!'âthus indeed Do We reward Those who do right. For this was obviously A trialâ." In other words: 'You have complied and submitted to the command of Allah and succeeded in this trial and test.'

WHY DO WE PELT THE JAMARAT?

1. We follow the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and follow his command. He threw pebbles at the Jamarat and said: "Take your Hajj rituals from me."

2. By doing so, we submit to Allah, His commands, and His laws. Hajj is a great form of worship which is filled with complete submission to Allah and His laws in all its entirety.

3. We remember the story of Allah's prophet Ibraahim, peace be upon him.

4. We anger Shaytaan with it, declaring that we are following the path of the Prophets in their enmity for him, for he gets angry when he sees people pelting the place where Ibraahim (peace be upon him) opposed him.

5. We remember Allah and glorify Him with our tongues and our hearts. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Going round the House (the Ka'bah), running between as-Safa and lapidation of the pillars are meant for the remembrance of Allah." This is why, with each pebble thrown, the pilgrim should say "Allaahu Akbar" (Allah is Greatest), as if declaring that Allah's glorification and love is greater than all whims and temptations.

HOW TO PELT THE JAMARAT

General Guidelines:
1. Go out to throw with your group and at the specific time which was allocated to your group in order to avoid crowding, getting lost, and harassing other pilgrims.

2. The Jamrah is pelted with seven separate pebbles, one pebble for each throw.

3. Declare the greatness of Allah with every throw by saying "Allaahu Akbar" (Allah is Greatest).

4. Be sure to stay away from crowds and try to approach the Jamrah from the least crowded side.

5. Direct your throw at the wall in front of you in the middle of the Jamrah so that the pebble falls into the basin located around the Jamrah.

6. Be careful not to hurt anyone with what you throw.

PELTING JAMARAT AL-AQABA ON THE DAY OF EID

Jamarat Al-Aqaba is the farthest Jamrah when you come to pelt. It is located at the end of Mina, towards Makkah, and it is the only Jamrah which a pilgrim pelts on the day of Eid.

Procedure:
- The pilgrim must pelt Jamarat Al-Aqaba on the day of Eid, the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah, or the night thereof, after leaving Muzdalifah
- The pilgrim throws seven pebbles, saying takbeer (Allaahu Akbar) with each one
- The pilgrim stops reciting the Talbiyah after pelting Jamarat Al-Aqabah
- Continue walking after pelting the Jamrah and do not stop so as not to disrupt the movement of pilgrims and to leave an opportunity for others

WHEN TO PELT JAMARAT AL-AQABA

The time for pelting Jamarat Al-Aqaba begins at midnight for those who hurry and leave Muzdalifah at night, and the time for pelting continues throughout the day of Eid. It is better not to delay the pelting until dawn on the eleventh day, for those who are able.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) left Muzdalifah between dawn and sunrise, and reached the Jamrah at the time of Duha (forenoon).

PELTING THE JAMARAT DURING THE DAYS OF TASHREEQ

Pilgrims pelt the Jamarat on the three days of Tashreeq:
- 11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah for those who delay
- 11th and 12th for those who hasten

Pelting the Jamarat is the most important ritual for pilgrims during these days, as they continue to remember Allah and perform Takbeer.

HOW TO PELT THE JAMARAT DURING THE DAYS OF TASHREEQ

The pilgrim should go out with his own group at the time specified for them and in the specified manner, whether it is by train or by walking to the Jamarat. The pilgrim takes the Jamarat road and follows the directions and instructions he receives.

Sequence of Pelting:

1. The Small Jamrah:
- The pilgrim begins with the Small Jamrah, which is the first one he will find
- Throws seven pebbles at it, reciting Takbeer with each throw
- Then moves away from the Jamrah, away from the crowds, and withdraws from the road so as not to affect the path of the pilgrims
- He turns towards the Qiblah, raises his hands in supplication, and prays for what he wants: mercy, forgiveness, reconciliation, and acceptance of his Hajj

2. The Middle Jamrah:
- After that, he walks to the middle (second) Jamrah and pelts it, just as he did with the one before it, with seven pebbles, reciting Takbeer with each throw
- Then he turns away from it, heading to Jamarat Al-Aqaba, withdraws from the road, supplicates to Allah and asks for whatever he wills

3. Jamarat Al-Aqaba:
- Finally, he sets out for Jamarat Al-Aqaba (the big one), which is the third of the Jamarat, and he pelts it as he did with the one before it, with seven pebbles
- But it is NOT prescribed for him to supplicate after pelting this Jamrah
- The pilgrims should not stop after they have finished stoning the Jamarat, so as not to disrupt the pilgrims' movement and their departure

Important Notes:
- Do not harm pilgrims by throwing trash in their way. Make use of the designated areas instead
- When going to the Jamarat, adhere to the specific rules of crowd control which are clearly defined, as they have been designed for your benefit and in service of the guests of Allah

THE RIGHT TIME FOR PELTING THE JAMARAT

All days of Tashreeq are considered the right time for pelting, until sunset on the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah.

Rest assured that all the times officially scheduled for pelting are in accordance with the opinions of reputable jurists and legal scholars.

The pilgrim must abide by the allotted time for his group to pelt, in coordination with the competent authorities.

APPOINTING A REPRESENTATIVE TO PELT ON YOUR BEHALF

The kingdom provided many services throughout the ritual sites and especially at the Jamarat. The arrangement of pelting the Jamarat has become smooth, safe and easy, enabling pilgrims to pelt the Jamarat and perform their rituals safely and smoothly.

Eligibility for Representation:
It is permissible for the elderly, the weak, the sick, pregnant women, and anyone who fears harm to himself by pelting, to assign someone from among the pilgrims to pelt the Jamarat on his behalf.

Procedure for Representatives:
The representative who will perform the pelting shall pelt the Jamrah on his own behalf first, then on behalf of whomever he represents. Then move to the next Jamrah and do the same, and so on until the final Jamrah.

DESCRIPTION OF THE THROWN PEBBLES

Characteristics:
- They should be small pebbles
- Smaller than hazelnuts, close to the size of peas or date pits
- Approximately 1cm in length
- One should not use large pebbles

Guidance on Selection:
- Do not waste too much time choosing the shape of the pebbles and their size
- After collecting the stones in his hand, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Throw something like these." Then he said: "O people, beware of exaggeration in religious matters for those who came before you were doomed because of exaggeration in religious matters."

PICKING UP PEBBLES FOR PELTING

For the Day of Eid:
It is prescribed for the pilgrim to pick up 7 pebbles before leaving Muzdalifah, which he will throw at Jamarat Al-Aqabah on the day of Eid. But if he collects them in Mina or any other place, then this is also permissible.

For the Days of Tashreeq:
It is not preferred to pick up pebbles for the rest of the days from Muzdalifah, so as not to burden the pilgrim, in addition to the fact that this is not prescribed. Pebbles for the rest of the days should be picked up in Mina or from anywhere else on the way.

Practical Notes:
- To make it easier for pilgrims, many groups nowadays provide pebbles, and there is nothing wrong with using them
- Be careful not to pick up pebbles in walking areas so as not to endanger yourself and others

THE JAMARAT THEN AND NOW

Historical Context:
In the past, pelting the Jamarat was fraught with difficulties due to the large crowds and the stampedes of pilgrims at specific points, in which a number of deaths occurred every year.

Modern Solution:

MADINAH LANDMARKS - A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

This guide contains information about important landmarks in Madinah for pilgrims visiting the holy city.

ABOUT MADINAH

Madinah was the destination the Prophet (peace be upon him) migrated to, resided in and was buried in after his death. It is the second holiest city in Islam after Makkah. It is also the first capital of Islam and the nucleus of Islamic civilization whose light has spread throughout the world.

THE VIRTUES AND POSITION OF MADINAH

Madinah is the second holiest site in Islam, on which Allah has conferred many virtues including:

It is the Home of Islam and Guidance:
Madinah was, and always will be, the home of Islam and guidance. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Faith will retreat to Madinah just as a snake retreats to its hole."

The Intercession of Allah's Messenger for Its Inhabitants:
Those who live in Madinah and patiently endure hardships will be blessed, for Allah's Messenger will intercede for them on Judgement Day. As he said: "No one from among my people will endure the hardship and rigour of Madinah without my being an intercessor on his behalf on the day of resurrection."

It Is a Blessed City:
The Messenger of Allah prayed to Allah to bless its food, sustenance, and everything else in it, saying: "O God, bless us in our fruits; bless us in our city; bless us in our sa'; and bless us in our mudd. O God, Abraham was Thy servant, friend and prophet, and I am Thy servant and prophet. He made supplication to Thee on behalf of Makkah, and I make on behalf of Madinah the same supplication as he made on behalf of Makkah and as much again."

It is a Sacred City:
It is a sacred city in which the reward for good deeds is multiplied and the sin incurred for bad deeds is considered graver. Harming its inhabitants in any way is considered one of the major sins in the sight of Allah.

THE NAMES OF MADINAH

Madinah has many names with significant meanings:

Madinah (The City): The prophet's City is self-defined. It is described as "An-Nabawiyyah" (the Prophet's city) and "Al-Munawwarah" (the Illuminated), because of the Prophet's light which illuminated it with Islam and guidance following his migration to it.

Daar Al-Hijrah (The Home of Migration): Named because it was honoured by the migration of Allah's Messenger and his companions to it and the safety and protection it afforded them.

Taybah (the City of Purity and Goodness): This name is derived from the Arabic adjective 'tayyib', meaning 'good, beautiful, and pure'. Named because of its pure soil, good inhabitants and the agreeable, peaceful life it affords its inhabitants.

THE PROPHET'S MOSQUE

Visiting the Prophet's Mosque is a highly recommended act. Visiting it is not restricted to a particular time, so one can visit it throughout the year.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "A journey must not be undertaken to visit any mosque but three: the Grand Mosque, this mosque of mine and Al-Aqsa Mosque."

Guidelines for Visiting the Prophet's Mosque:
- Enter with your right foot first
- Recite the supplication for entering mosques
- Leave it with your left foot first
- Recite the supplication for leaving mosques
- Perform voluntary prayers in the Honorable Rawdhah, after obtaining permission to pray there, taking care to avoid peak times and crowds
- Engage in supplication and remembrance of Allah
- Send your greetings to the Prophet and his two companions while abiding by the prescribed Islamic rules
- Make best use of time by performing obligatory prayers in the Prophet's Mosque. The Prophet said: "Performing one single prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers performed in any other mosque, except the Grand Mosque."

QUBA'A MOSQUE

History and Significance:
- The first mosque built in Islam
- Constructed by the Prophet as he approached Madinah
- The Prophet stayed in Quba'a for four days, and on the fifth day continued his journey to Madinah with Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq
- Allah says about this mosque: "There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of thy standing forth (for prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and God loveth those who make themselves pure." (9:108)

Virtues: The Prophet used to visit Quba'a Mosque and pray in it. He said: "Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the Quba' Mosque and offers one prayer therein, will have a reward like that for Umrah."

Location: Southwest of Madinah, in an area that abounds in palm tree farms

Current Details:

The route is 3.6 km long and abounds in shops, cafes and restaurants serving traditional dishes. It is highly convenient for night walks in hot weather.

AL-QIBLATAYN MOSQUE

Historical Significance:
The mosque where the change of qiblah took place for the first time. When the Messenger of Allah was in Makkah, he used to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) in prayers, with the Ka'bah in front of him. When he migrated to Madinah, he continued facing Jerusalem for more than a year until Allah granted his wish and revealed: "We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens; now shall We turn thee to a Qiblah that shall please thee. Turn then thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque" (2:144).

The Change: This happened when the Messenger was leading Muslims during Dhuhr prayer in the quarters of Banu Salamah. Halfway into the prayer, he received divine revelations to change the direction of prayer, and moved with those behind him to face the Ka'ba instead of Jerusalem, hence the name 'Masjid Al Qiblatayn (the Mosque of the two qiblas).

Location: 4 km away from the Prophet's Mosque, in the Banu Salamah District.

MINA: A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

MINA'S STATUS

A small valley which contains all of the sacred sites and memories of pilgrims, not only today, but from the ancient history of mankind, many prophets prayed and stayed here.

It still embraces pilgrims at the beginning of their journey, from the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah until the completion of Hajj, covering the Day of Sacrifice and the Days of Tashreeq.

THE BOUNDARIES OF MINA AND INFORMATION ABOUT IT

Mina is a valley within the boundaries of the Haram, extending from east to west, surrounded by mountains from the north and south, and bounded by Wadi Muhassir in the east to the Big Jamrah.

Physical Specifications:
- Length: approximately 3.2 km (2 miles)
- Area: 7.82 kmÂ² (3.02 square miles) according to Islamic law
- Approximately 61% of Mina's area is used by pilgrims
- The remaining 39% consists of mountainous terrain which is difficult to inhabit
- Some mountain peaks rise 500m (1640 ft) above the valley surface

If Mina becomes too narrow for the pilgrims, there is room for leniency and it is possible to stay in the areas next to it within the boundaries of the Haram.

WHY IS IT NAMED MINA?

Mina may have been named for one of two reasons:

1. Due to the sacrifices made to become closer to Allah after completing the rituals; 'mina' means 'sacrifice'.

2. It is said that our father Adam (PBUH) was in Mina, and Jibreel (Gabriel) said to him upon leaving: "Make a wish (tamanna)!" He said "I wish (atamanna) for Paradise", so it was called Mina from "At-Tamanni" (requesting a wish).

MINA ON THE EIGHTH DAY (AT-TARWIYAH)

Most pilgrims stay in Mina on the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah, during which they pray Dhuhr in a state of Ihraam. Pilgrims remain there until Fajr on the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah.

This day was called Yawm At-Tarwiyah (the Day of Irrigation). The name originates from the ancient tradition of people having to carry water with them in preparation for the Day of Arafah.

REACHING MINA

Upon Arrival:
- Take all your luggage from the bus
- Find out about the services available at your camp
- Find out the camp's location, its number, nearest landmarks, and metro station number (if your group uses the metro)
- Record the camp's geographical location using GPS service on your mobile phone
- Know who your group supervisor is to refer to them when needed
- Do not leave the camp unless necessary, and only after obtaining permission from your group supervisor

Warning: All roads and camps are very similar in Mina.

HOW TO SPEND THE EIGHTH DAY IN MINA

1. Make sure to prepare what you need for the Day of Arafah
2. Read and learn about the rulings and etiquette of Hajj
3. Make sure to frequently perform Talbiyah, recite the Qur'an and remember Allah
4. Supplicate to Allah to make Hajj easier for you and that He may accept it from you
5. Pilgrims shorten their prayers in congregation (jamaa'ah) in their camps
6. Make sure to rest and sleep well before the Day of Arafah

THE DAYS OF TASHREEQ

The days of Tashreeq are the three days after Eid-ul-Adha: 11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah, which are days of Eid and joy following the completion of Hajj.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said about these days: "The days of Tashreeq are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah."

The name 'Tashreeq' originates from the practice of slaughtering the sacrifice on the day of Eid, where people would cut the meat and expose it under the sun, so that it would dry and not spoil. This method of food preparation is called 'Tashreeq'.

TAKBEER DURING THE DAYS OF TASHREEQ

It is Sunnah for the pilgrim to perform takbeer and to repeat it during the days of Tashreeq at all times, especially after the obligatory prayers.

Takbeer recitations:
"Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha il-Allaah. Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa lillaahil-hamd."
(Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest. There is no deity besides Allah and Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest and all praises are for Allah only.)

"Allaahu akbar kabeeran, wal-hamdu lillaahi katheeran, wa subhaan Allaahi bukratan wa aseelan."
(Allah is the Greatest, Most Great. Praise is to Allah, abundantly, glory is to Allah, at the break of day and at its end.)

PELTING THE JAMARAT

The greatest deed a pilgrim can enact during the days of Tashreeq is pelting the Jamarat.

Requirements:
- Pick up 21 pebbles per day to pelt the three Jamarat (7 pebbles for each Jamrah)
- Go to the Jamarat according to the time allotted to your group

3. Jamarat Al-Aqaba (The Big Jamrah - Third):

HOW TO GET TO THE JAMARAT

Exceptions:
- Those with legitimate excuses (menstruation or postpartum bleeding) are exempt
- If a pilgrim delays Tawaf al-Ifaadah until departure time, it suffices for both Tawaf al-Ifaadah and Tawaf Al-Wada'

MUZDALIFAH: A GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

MUZDALIFAH

After experiencing the great moments during the Day of Arafah you will now move to the third leg of your journey of faith, which is to Muzdalifah. Allah the Almighty said: "Then pass on at a quick pace from the place whence it is usual for the multitude so to do and ask for God's forgiveness. For God is Oft Forgiving Most Merciful."

ETYMOLOGY AND NAMES

Muzdalifah was named for one of two reasons:
1. Because people approach (yazdalifoona) from here, meaning: they are approaching the Haram.
2. Because people spend nearly all of the night (zulfan min al-layl) in it, which means: moments and hours of the night.

Other names:
- "Jam'" because the people gather there (from the Arabic root jama-'a, meaning: to gather)
- "Al-Mash'ar Al-Haraam" (the Sacred Monument) because it is part of the Haram, as mentioned in the Qur'an

THE LOCATION OF MUZDALIFAH

Muzdalifah is located between Mina and Arafat.

Specifications:
- Area: 9,630 mÂ²
- It is all considered a valid place to stand, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "I have stood here, but all Jam' is a place for standing" (meaning: Muzdalifah)

WHAT TO DO IN MUZDALIFAH

Arrival and Initial Activities:
- Hajj groups differ in preparing a place for Muzdalifah, but most provide carpets, bedding and snacks, and use public toilets
- The moment you arrive you must combine and shorten Maghrib and 'Ishaa prayers with your group

Rest and Preparation:
- Make sure you rest and sleep as much as you can during your stay in Muzdalifah in preparation for the day of Eid
- The weather in Muzdalifah in recent years tends to be hot, so women should choose a covering dress which is not too thick
- Make sure to carry your usual medication and to take it with you during this night

Spiritual Activities:
- While awake, strive to remain in remembrance of Allah, praise Him, and perform Talbiyah
- Feel the extent of Allah's blessings upon you; that He guided you, made Hajj easy for you, made you reach Arafah, and granted you success by enabling you to supplicate to Him
- As Allah the Almighty said: "Celebrate the praises of God at the Sacred Monument and celebrate His praises as He has directed you even though before this ye went astray"

AL-MASH'AR AL-HARAAM MOSQUE

This is a mosque erected in the place where the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stayed in Muzdalifah during the Farewell Pilgrimage.

Location:
- Located in Muzdalifah, between the fourth pedestrian road and King Faisal Road
- Located approximately in the middle between Namirah Mosque and Al-Khayf Mosque
- 5 km (3.1 miles) away from Al-Khayf Mosque
- 7 km (4.3 miles) away from Namirah Mosque

Specifications:
- Dimensions: 90 metres long and 56 metres wide
- Capacity: accommodates more than 12,000 worshippers
- Features: two minarets, each 32 metres high

EATING AND STREET VENDORS

Some street vendors may sell food and drinks, but you are advised not to eat anything from them and to limit yourself to the food and drinks which your group provides.

Food Safety Guidelines:
- Avoid eating any food cooked by street vendors
- Remember that keeping cooked food at room temperature for more than two hours leads to the proliferation of germs and the possibility of food poisoning
- Make sure to wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating them
- Beware of drinking very cold drinks

COLD AND FLU PREVENTION

Some respiratory diseases begin to spread during the days of Hajj. Prevention methods include:

Personal Protection:
- Avoid contact with infected people, and avoid using the patient's utensils and personal items
- Pay attention to the cleanliness of your hands, and avoid touching your eyes and nose
- Take care to avoid crowding as much as possible, and wear a face mask at all times
- Avoid drinking very cold water
- When you arrive at the camp, do not sit directly in front of the air conditioners, especially when you are sweating, as the extreme variation in body temperature affects your health

THE DURATION OF THE STAY IN MUZDALIFAH

Timing:
- The time for standing in Muzdalifah begins after sunset on the day of Arafah (9 Dhul-Hijjah)

Scholarly Opinions:
- The Madhhabs (schools of jurisprudence) have a difference of opinion about the amount of time one should stay in Muzdalifah
- Some say that it is sufficient to pass through and have a short break
- Others say it is necessary to stay until midnight, to spend two-thirds of the night there, or until dawn

Prophetic Example:
- The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) remained in Muzdalifah until Fajr prayer. Then he supplicated to Allah, after which he went to Mina
- The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) also gave permission for women and those accompanying them to leave Muzdalifah before dawn, and among them was Ibn 'Abbaas

Practical Guidance:
- The pilgrim should abide by the time set by his group when moving from Muzdalifah, because there is room for leniency in this matter
- The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) permitted those Companions who sought permission, particularly if there are women and elderly people in their group

PICKING UP PEBBLES TO PELT THE JAMARAT

Basic Requirements:
- It is prescribed for the pilgrim to pick up 7 pebbles before leaving Muzdalifah, which he will use to pelt Jamarat Al-Aqaba on the day of Eid
- If he collects them in Mina or any other place, then that is also permissible

Additional Pebbles:
- It is not preferred to pick up the pebbles for the rest of the days from Muzdalifah, so as not to burden the pilgrim, in addition to the fact that this is not prescribed
- Pebbles for the rest of the days should be picked up in Mina or from anywhere else on the way

Important Notes:
- It is not prescribed for pilgrim to wash the pebbles or apply perfume on them

A DESCRIPTION OF THE PEBBLES USED FOR PELTING

Size and Characteristics:
- They should be small pebbles
- Smaller than hazelnuts, close to the size of peas or date pits
- Approximately 1 cm in length, more or less
- One should not use large pebbles

Guidance on Selection:
- Do not waste too much time choosing the shape of the pebbles and their size
- After he had collected the stones in his hand, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Throw something like these." Then he said: "O people, beware of exaggeration in religious matters for those who came before you were doomed because of exaggeration in religious matters"

HOW TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION IN MUZDALIFAH

Navigation Guidelines:
- You should stay within the location and the camp of your own group and not leave unless necessary
- Save your location via GPS services on your phone such as Google Maps
- Clearly identify the most important nearby landmark and make sure you have someone to accompany you
- Buses, roads and stations look similar, so make sure to stay with your group and do not venture outside alone
- Know the supervisor of your bus or group and ask his permission or consult him if you need anything

TOILETS

Availability and Location:
- Toilets can be located on all sides of Muzdalifah
- Next to your place of arrival you will find a complex of toilets and a place to perform ablution for men, and another for women

Etiquette and Guidelines:
- Wait for your turn and do not skip the line by taking the turn of someone who needs to use the toilet facilities and arrived before you
- Make sure to leave the toilet clean for the next person and throw your trash in the designated places
- Do not harm pilgrims by littering their path with rubbish, as this site is part of the Haram that we have been commanded to purify
- Muslims are required to be clean and pure in all circumstances: "For God loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean"

THE PROPHET'S MOSQUE GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

ABOUT MADINAH
Madinah was the abode where the Prophet Muhammad migrated to and resided, and the place where his grave and his honorable body are. It is the second holiest city for Muslims after Makkah. It was also the first capital of Islam, and the nucleus of Islamic civilization whose light spread throughout the world.

MADINAH'S VIRTUE AND POSITION
The Prophet's city is the second holiest spot in Islam, and Allah has singled it out with many virtues:

HOME OF ISLAM AND GUIDANCE
The Prophet's city was and will remain the home of Islam and guidance. The Prophet said: "Faith will shrink back to Medina as a snake shrinks back to its hole."

BLESSED CITY
Blessing means the abundance and growth of goodness. The Messenger of Allah supplicated for Madinah to be blessed in its food, sustenance, and all its affairs, when he said: "O Allah, bless us in our fruits; bless us in our city; bless us in our saa' and bless us in our mudd. O Allah, Ibraahim (Abraham) was Thy servant, friend and prophet, and I am Thy servant and prophet. He made supplication to Thee on behalf of Makkah, and I make on behalf of Madinah the same supplication as he made on behalf of Makkah, and as much again."

SANCTUARY
A sanctuary in which (the reward for) good deeds are multiplied, and bad deeds are magnified. Harming its people is considered one of the greatest sins in the sight of Allah.

DIFFERENT NAMES OF MADINAH
The city of the Prophet has several names which carry great meanings:

MADINAH (THE CITY)
Every city is ascribed to what follows it (like: the city of London, the city of Amsterdam, etc), except for the city of Allah's Messenger, as it is THE city defined by itself.

AN-NABAWIYYAH (PROPHETIC)
It is described as An-Nabawiyyah (prophetic), referring to the Prophet Muhammad.

MUNAWWARAH (ENLIGHTENED)
It is described as Munawwarah (enlightened) because of the light of the Chosen One, who illuminated it with guidance and the religion of Islam after the migration.

DAAR-UL-HIJRAH (THE ABODE OF HIJRAH)
Because it was the land which had the honour to welcome the Messenger of Allah and his companions and had the honour to come to their aid and defend them.

TAYBAH
Which is derived from "At-Tayyib", meaning something which is good, nice, beautiful, pure, and graceful. This is because of the purity of its soil, the goodness of its inhabitants, and the good quality of life in it.

THE PROPHET'S MOSQUE
The second greatest mosque in Islam after the Grand Mosque (in Makkah) is the Prophet's Mosque. It was built by the Messenger of Allah and his companions after their migration to Madinah. It was a center of knowledge and civilization, where the Qur'an was recited and the companions gathered with our Noble Messenger, benefiting from his blessing and guidance.

Muslims have successively built and taken care of it, following their Noble Messenger. It was expanded more than once by the Kings of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. After the expansions carried out by the Saudi state in the mosque on all different floors, its prayer area is now bigger than 500,000 square metres. It accommodates up to 1,000,000 worshippers at peak times.

MULTIPLICATION OF PRAYERS
The reward for a prayer performed in the Prophet's Mosque is multiplied, as the Prophet said: "And a prayer performed in this mosque of mine is equal to a thousand prayers in any other mosque, except for the Grand Mosque (in Makkah)."

TRAVELLING TO VISIT THE MOSQUE
It is desirable for a Muslim, if he is able, to travel to pray in the Prophet's Mosque, as the prophet said: "Animals are saddled only for prayer in the three mosques: the Grand Mosque, the Aqsa mosque, and this mosque of mine."

DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MOSQUE

THE OLD MOSQUE
This is the mosque in which the Messenger of Allah and his companions prayed. Its historical shape and ancient inscriptions have been preserved.

AS-SARHAAT (THE COURTYARDS)
Two roofless areas behind the old mosque. In the past, they were furnished with pebbles, and for this reason the Sarhah is called: Al-Haswah (the place covered with pebbles). Nowadays, there are sunshades which open automatically during the day to protect worshipers from the sun, and they close at night to ventilate the mosque.

THE EXPANSIONS
These are the other buildings of the mosque, surrounding the Sarhaat.

THE OPEN SQUARES
These are large areas prepared for worshipers, covered with sunshades which open and close automatically to protect worshipers from the sun, and also contain ventilation and mist sprayers to cool the air for worshipers. Area: 235,000 square meters. Accommodates: 450,000 worshippers.

MOSQUE STATISTICS
- 229 indoor and outdoor gates
- 196 fixed and moving domes
- 10 minarets
- 10,496 Quran holders
- 262 sunshades in the open square and inside the mosque
- 424 mist fans

AL-HUJRAH ASH-SHAREEFAH (THE HONORABLE ROOM)
The name (Honorable Room) is given to the house of the Prophet in which he was staying with the mother of the believers, 'Aishah bint Abi Bakr Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with her and her father. Allah Almighty honored 'Aishah by placing in her room the tomb of the Prophet and his two companions, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with them both.

This Honorable Room is located to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, and its door opens directly to the Honorable Rawdhah. For this reason, the Prophet may have offered his head to 'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, so that she could comb his hair while he was in seclusion in the mosque.

When the Messenger of Allah fell ill, he passed away in 'Aishah's room, after he had asked permission from the mothers of the believers to be nursed in 'Aishah's room, may Allah be pleased with her, and they gave him permission.

After the Prophet died, he was buried where he died, because he said: "Every prophet is buried where he dies." So he was buried in this room. Then his two companions, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and Umar bin Al-Khattab, were buried there after him.

The room remained outside the mosque but then became a part of it after the subsequent expansions which took place in the mosque. Muslims took great care to protect the Honorable Room from rain, floods, and the enemies of Islam, with a building and walls which preserve the Honorable Room for its occupant and which preserve the commandment of the Messenger of Allah that his grave should not be taken as a place of celebration or a place for polytheism and worship of other than Allah.

Above the room today, we find a distinctive green dome marking the room. It was painted green in 1253H.

GIVING GREETINGS (SALAAM) TO THE PROPHET
It is recommended for anyone who is in Madinah to visit the grave of the Prophet and greet him.

DESCRIPTION OF VISITING THE GRAVE OF THE PROPHET

STEP 1: ENTERING
One enters through the Salaam Gate at the front of the Prophet's Mosque, to the east, and walks with serenity and dignity.

STEP 2: GREETING THE PROPHET
When one reaches the Prophet's room, the place of his honorable grave, he greets the Noble Messenger and says: "As-salaamu 'alayka yaa Rasool-Allah, wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu" (Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allah, and Allah's mercy and blessings). Then he offers prayers upon the Prophet (by saying: "Allaahumma salli 'aala Muhammad, etc).

Extended greeting may include: "As-salaamu 'alayka yaa Nabiyy Allah, As-salaamu 'alayka yaa kheeratullaah min khalqihi, as-salaamu 'alayka yaa Sayyid-al-Mursaleena wa imaam-al-muttaqeena. Ash-hadu annaka qad balaghta ar-risaalatah wa addaytal-amaanah, wa nasahtal-ummah, wa jaahadta fillaahi haqqa jihaadihi. Allaahumma salli 'aala Muhammad wa 'aala aali Muhammad kamaa sallayta 'aala Ibraaheema wa 'aala aali Ibraaheema, innaka hameedun majeed. Wa baarik 'aala Muhammad wa 'aala aali Muhammad, kamaa baarakta 'aala Ibraaheema wa 'aala aali Ibraaheema, innaka hameedun majeed."

Translation: "Peace be upon you, O Prophet of Allah, peace be upon you, O beloved of Allah, peace be upon you, O Master of the Messengers and leader of the pious. I bear witness that you have delivered the message, fulfilled the trust, advised the Ummah, and strived for the sake of Allah in the best way possible. Oh Allah, praise Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you praised Ibraaheem (Abraham) and the family of Ibraaheem, indeed, You are praiseworthy and glorious. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you blessed Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem, verily, You are praiseworthy and glorious."

STEP 3: GREETING ABU BAKR
Then he should take a step and greet Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.

STEP 4: GREETING UMAR
Then he should take a step and greet 'Umar Ibn Al-Khattab.

IMPORTANT ETIQUETTE FOR VISITING
- One must stand with respect and good manners, and not raise his voice. The Prophet is revered, both alive and dead.
- Allah the Almighty said: "O ye who believe! Raise not your voices Above the voice of the Prophet, Nor speak aloud to him In talk, as ye may Speak aloud to one another, Lest your deeds become Vain and ye perceive not. Those that lower their voice In the presence of God's Apostle,âtheir hearts Has God tested for piety: For them is Forgiveness And a great Reward."
- When greeting him, one should stand as close to him as possible, facing the grave.
- When greeting, one should only stand for a short while, to also give other visitors the opportunity to greet, and so as not to cause crowding and noise.
- One should not wipe the grave or anything around it.
- One should not ask the Prophet to fulfil his needs, relieve him of trouble, or heal a sick person, because all of this is only asked from Allah Almighty, the Living who does not die. The Prophet came with Tawheed (monotheism) and rejected shirk (polytheism).
- After this, he should leave just as he entered; with serenity and dignity, to make room for those who are behind him who have also come to greet our Noble Messenger.

THE HONORABLE RAWDHAH
The Honorable Rawdhah is part of the Prophet's Mosque. It is located at the front of the mosque, and extends from the house of the Messenger of Allah (the Honorable Room) to his pulpit.

The Rawdhah is a place of high rank, with a great impact on the soul, in which mercy and blessings descend. This is where the Messenger of Allah and his companions used to pray, supplicate, and remember Allah in all their conditions. It is the best part of the Prophet's Mosque. The Prophet said: "What is between my house and my pulpit is one of the gardens of Paradise."

HOW IS THE RAWDHAH ONE OF THE GARDENS OF PARADISE?
This place is similar to the Gardens of Paradise in the attainment of happiness and tranquility for those who sit in it. Worship and prayers conducted in this place lead to the garden of Paradise.

HOW TO PRAY IN THE HONORABLE RAWDHAH
In view of the large number of people who are eager to pray in the Honorable Rawdhah, and to reduce crowding, whoever wants to visit the Rawdhah should book through the official app, in which times and places of entry are determined.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ENTERING THE PROPHET'S MOSQUE

ACCESSIBILITY
Most gates are wheelchair accessible. Wheelchairs are available for the elderly and those who need them next to the main gates inside the mosque.

SHOE STORAGE
When you enter the mosque, you can put your shoes at the gate in the designated places, or in the boxes which can be found everywhere inside the mosque. Remember the box number and do not forget it, because there are similar boxes all around. It is courteous to others to ensure you place your shoes in the designated areas rather than in the way of other pilgrims.

FACILITIES AND SERVICES
- Usually there are places to break your fast on Mondays and Thursdays inside the Prophet's Mosque.
- All water available for drinking in the Prophet's Mosque is from the well of Zamzam, transported to the Prophet's Mosque with the highest standards of safety and hygiene.
- There are study circles inside the Prophet's Mosque; pilgrims can join them and learn the recitation and memorisation of the Qur'an amongst other things, taught by specialized teachers.
- In the mosque's external squares, there are places to perform ablution (Wudhu), to save the worshiper the hassle of going to external toilets.
- In case you need a health check, there are two health centers in the squares of the Sanctuary.

BEHAVIOR AND ETIQUETTE
Always remember that this is a place where the Messenger of Allah and his honorable companions walked, worshipped, and remembered Allah in all their conditions. Also remember that his honourable grave is near you, so fill your time with what benefits you, and beware of raising your voice and laughing. Be careful not to be distracted by your mobile phone.

CLEANLINESS
In case you drop anything on the carpets or marble of the mosque which causes it to become dirty, request the help of a cleaner to remove it.

MOVEMENT AND PRAYER
The corridors inside the mosque are designated for walking and moving, so performing your prayers in them will obstruct free passage and will cause crowding.

SAFETY IN SQUARES
- Beware of slipping in the square, and wear shoes that are slip resistant.
- Smoking is prohibited in the squares of the Sanctuary.
- Be careful not to stand further to the front than the Imam during prayer in the southern square of the mosque. You can know the directions for aligning with the Imam, so as not to stand in front of him, through the signs in the square.
- Walking barefoot in the squares: If you lose your shoes or need to search for them in the squares in the heat, try to walk on the white marble only because it is cool. Beware of walking barefoot on black or coloured marble, because this can be extremely hot and can lead to injuries.

NAVIGATION
- All the gates of the mosque are numbered with clear numbers next to each gate, so you can reach the gate you want by learning the gate number.
- The gates of the squares of the Prophet's Mosque are also numbered and are written on the gates of the outer wall of the squares. They are different from the numbers on the gates of the Prophet's Mosque.
UMRAH GUIDE FOR PILGRIMS

WHAT IS UMRAH
Umrah is one of the best deeds and acts which draw you closer to Allah. When performing Umrah, the pilgrim turns toward the House of Allah with his heart, tongue, limbs, and seeks His mercy and pleasure. Umrah is an act of worshipping Allah by entering the state of Ihraam, performing Tawaf around the Ka'ba, Sa'i between Safaa and Marwa, and shaving or trimming your hair.

VIRTUES OF UMRAH
- It cleanses sins and removes poverty and need. The Prophet said: "Perform Hajj and Umrah consecutively; for they remove poverty and sin as the bellows removes impurity from iron."
- Repeating Umrah expiates the sins committed between them. The Prophet said: "From one Umrah to the next is an expiation for what was committed between them."

UMRAH STEP BY STEP

STEP 1: ENTERING IHRAAM
A Muslim enters into the state of Ihraam from the place specified for him by Islamic law, and he abstains from the prohibitions which he is prohibited from while in Ihraam. He recites the Talbiyah, saying: "Labbayk-Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk. Innal hamda wan-ni'matah laka wal-mulk, laa shareeka lak." (At Your service, Allah, at Your service. At Your service, You have no partner, at Your service. Truly all praise, favour and sovereignty is Yours. You have no partner.)

STEP 2: TAWAF
He goes to the Haram, performs Tawaf around the Ka'ba seven times, with the Ka'ba to his left. He begins at the Black Stone and ends at the Black Stone. After completion, he prays two rak'aas.

STEP 3: SA'I
He heads to Safa, and from here he heads towards Marwa. If he reaches Marwa, he has completed one circuit. Then he returns to Safa to complete the second circuit, and so on, until he completes seven circuits, ending in Marwa.

STEP 4: HAIR CUTTING
Men shave or trim their hair, and women gather their hair and cut from its ends as much as a fingertip (1-2 cm). Thus, the Umrah is complete and Ihraam ends.

HAJJ AT-TAMATTU
Tamattu' refers to a person who wishes to perform Hajj and first enters into the state of Ihraam to perform his Umrah. Then, after completing his Umrah, he leaves the state of Ihraam, only to re-enter the state of Ihraam on the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah.

How to perform At-Tamattu:

About Safa and Marwa:
Safa and Marwa are two small mountains where Hagar climbed searching for food and water. Safa is where Sa'i begins, Marwa is where it ends. Sa'i between them is a ritual of Hajj and Umrah as Allah said: "Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of God."

Supplications during Sa'i:
At beginning of Safa or Marwa, raise hands toward Qiblah and supplicate. The Prophet's supplication when first reaching Safa: "Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of God. I begin with that which Allah began with."

When climbing Safa and Marwa, face Qiblah and say: "Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha il-Allaah, wahdahu, laa shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul-hamdu wa huwa 'aala kulli shay'in qadeer. Laa ilaaha il-Allaahu wahdahu. Anjaza wa'dahu, wa nasara 'abdahu, wa hazamal-ahzaaba wahdahu." Repeat three times with personal supplications.
